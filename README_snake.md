# Snake Game


## Description
Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that eats apples - in our version of this game the snake eats apple pies - and grows longer. The goal of the game is to eat as many apples (apple pies) as possible without colliding with the snake's own body. The Snake Game is implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

## Game Features
- The snake moves within a rectangular game field.
- The snake grows longer when it eats an apple pie.
- The movement direction of the snake can be controlled using the arrow keys.
- The game ends when the snake collides with its own body.
- If the snake exits the game field, it should appear on the opposite side at the same position.
- After the game ends, the player can restart the game by pressing the Enter key.
- There is a score displayed, indicating how many apple pies the snake has eaten.
- The game background is accompanied by background music and sound effects.
- The game uses images to represent the snake, apple pies, and background.
- The game displays a "Game Over" message when the snake collides.

## Gameplay Instructions
1. Start the game by running the Python file.
2. Control the snake using the arrow keys (left, right, up, down) on the game field.
3. Eat as many apple pies as possible to score points and make the snake grow longer.
4. Avoid collisions with the snake's own body, as this will end the game.
5. When the game ends, press the Enter key to restart the game.

## Installation

2. Install the Pygame library by running the following command: pip install pygame

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while running the game, try the following:
- Ensure you have the latest version of Python and Pygame installed.
- Check that the required image and sound files are present in the correct directories.
- Verify that your system's audio settings are configured correctly.
- Maybe you need a creation of virtual environments (venv) to run the code.
- Make sure your version of Python supports f-strings (Python 3.6 or later).
